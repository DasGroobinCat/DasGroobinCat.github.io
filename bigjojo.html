<h1>Who is Big Jojo?</h1><br>
<p>"Big Jojo" is my alter ego, created after I went to China in 2009 to pursue an English teaching career.  "Jojo" was my childhood nickname and I used it in China because it was easy for the local people to remember.  My kindergarten students called me "Big Jojo" because I was so much taller than them.</p><br>
